#Movie list #test task Angular + NodeJS + TS I've been using Angular13 and npm 7.20.2 and NodeJS v14.15.5 and TS 4.5.4

for running the Angular example you should open folder movielist in your console and type, npm i then type npm start it will be running in dev mode on the port 3030 you will see the error message if you will not run NodeJS example

for running NodeJS example open folder movielist/server and run another one console and type npm i then type npm start it will be running on the port 3031

you can find NodeJS example without TypeScript on branch `sort`
